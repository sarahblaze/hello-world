# hello-world
This is this 
Someone is coming,
first with a cane, then with a white flower.
Someone is coming,
to confront the whole world
Who suspects, why
the pain of being botn wakes him from his dreams?
Who knows, where
his memories lead from a to, 
Who recognizes, how
a deep well forms from his eyes looking.
