# hello-world
This is this 
-
Someone is coming,
first with a cane, then with a white flower.
Someone is coming,
to confront the whole world.
Who suspects, why
the pain of being botn wakes him from his dreams?
Who knows, where
his memories lead from and to?
Who recognizes, how
a deep well forms beneath his search eyes?
